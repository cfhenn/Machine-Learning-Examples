# Machine-Learning-Examples

Uses tensorflow to create a convolutional neural network to detect lung cancer in 3D lung scans. 

Based on the 2017 Kaggle Data Science Bowl problem.

The set of 3D images was too big for github, so this program doesn't actually do anything unless I can figure out a way around that. For now, this code is simply here to provide a work sample to prospective employers.
